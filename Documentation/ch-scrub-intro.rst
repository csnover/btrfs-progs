Scrub is a validation pass over all filesystem data and metadata that detects
checksum errors, super block errors, metadata block header errors, and disk
read errors. All copies of replicated profiles are validated by default.

On filesystems that use replicated block group profiles (e.g. raid1), scrub will
also automatically repair any damage by default by copying verified good data
from one of the other replicas.

.. warning::
   Files with the NOCOW (``chattr +C``) attribute imply ``nodatasum``.
   Errors in these files cannot be detected or corrected by scrub. This means
   the NOCOW attribute is not currently safe in the presence of replicas since
   btrfs cannot determine which copy of data to use after a failure and may
   return data from any replica, including corrupt or outdated data.
   Detecting and recovering from a failure in this case requires manual
   intervention. See issue `#482 <https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/issues/482>`_.
   
   Notably, `systemd sets NOCOW on journals by default <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/11689d2a021d95a8447d938180e0962cd9439763>`_,
   and `libvirt â‰¥ 6.6 sets NOCOW on storage pool directories by default <https://www.libvirt.org/news.html#v6-6-0-2020-08-02>`_.
   Other distributions may also enable NOCOW on database files or directories to
   try to improve performance.

.. warning::
   A read-write scrub will do no further harm to a damaged filesystem if it is not
   possible to perform a correct repair, so it is safe to use at almost any time.
   However, if a split-brain event occurs, btrfs scrub may cause unrecoverable data
   loss. This situation is unlikely and requires a specific sequence of events that
   cause an unhealthy device or device set to be mounted read-write in the absence
   of the healthy device or device set from the same filesystem. For example:

   1. Device set F fails and drops from the bus, while device set H continues to
      function and receive additional writes.
   2. After a reboot, healthy set H does not reappear immediately, but failed set
      F does.
   3. Failed set F is mounted read-write. At this point, it is no longer safe for
      set H to reappear as the transaction histories have diverged. Allowing set H
      and set F to recombine at any point will cause corruption of set H. Running
      scrub on a split-brained filesystem will overwrite good data from set H with
      other data from set F, increasing the amount of permanent data loss.

.. note::
   Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck). It can only detect filesystem damage
   using the (:doc:`Tree-checker`) and checksum validation, and it can only repair
   filesystem damage by copying from other known good replicas.

   :doc:`btrfs-check` performs more exhaustive checking and can sometimes be
   used, with expert guidance, to rebuild certain corrupted filesystem structures
   in the absence of any good replica. However, when a replica exists, scrub is
   able to automatically correct most errors reported by ``btrfs-check``, so should
   normally be run first to avoid false positives from ``btrfs-check``.

The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system service. The
recommended period is a month but it could be less. The estimated device bandwidth
utilization is about 80% on an idle filesystem.

The scrubbing status is recorded in :file:`/var/lib/btrfs/` in textual files named
*scrub.status.UUID* for a filesystem identified by the given UUID. (Progress
state is communicated through a named pipe in file *scrub.progress.UUID* in the
same directory.) The status file is updated every 5 seconds. A resumed scrub
will continue from the last saved position.

Scrub can be started only on a mounted filesystem, though it's possible to
scrub only a selected device. See :ref:`btrfs scrub start<man-scrub-start>` for more.

Bandwidth and IO limiting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   The :manref:`ionice(1)` may not be generally supported by all IO schedulers and
   the options to :command:`btrfs scrub start` may not work as expected.

In the past when the `CFQ IO scheduler
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_fair_queueing>`__ was generally used
the :manref:`ionice(1)` syscalls set the priority to *idle* so the IO would not
interfere with regular IO. Since the kernel 5.0 the CFQ is not available.

The IO scheduler known to support that is `BFQ
<https://docs.kernel.org/block/bfq-iosched.html>`__, but first read the
documentation before using it!

For other commonly used schedulers like `mq-deadline
<https://docs.kernel.org/block/blk-mq.html>`__ it's recommended to use
*cgroup2 IO controller* which could be managed by e.g. *systemd*
(documented in ``systemd.resource-control``). However, starting scrub like that
is not yet completely straightforward. The IO controller must know the physical
device of the filesystem and create a slice so all processes started from that
belong to the same accounting group.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ systemd-run -p "IOReadBandwidthMax=/dev/sdx 10M" btrfs scrub start -B /

Since linux 5.14 it's possible to set the per-device bandwidth limits in a
BTRFS-specific way using files :file:`/sys/fs/btrfs/FSID/devinfo/DEVID/scrub_speed_max`.
This setting is not persistent, lasts until the filesystem is unmounted.
Currently set limits can be displayed by command :ref:`btrfs scrub
limit<man-scrub-limit>`.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ echo 100m > /sys/fs/btrfs/9b5fd16e-1b64-4f9b-904a-74e74c0bbadc/devinfo/1/scrub_speed_max
